# **VIM Setup for better view**

Best practices following [this reference article](https://medium.com/@jeantimex/how-to-configure-iterm2-and-vim-like-a-pro-on-macos-e303d25d5b5c)

- [Vim Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) is an awesome Vim plugin that polishes the status bar, it provides a lot of styles.
- In order to install Vim Airline, let’s ask a Vim plugin manager to help us, I use [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), run the following command to install it.

  ```sh
  curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
  ```

- Once Vim Plug is installed, edit `~/.vimrc`

  ```sh
  vi ~/.vimrc
  ```

- Add following line below to `.vimrc`

  ```sh
  call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
  Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
  Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline-themes'
  call plug#end()
  ```

- Save the changes and exit edit mode by press `Esc` then type `:wq` and then press `Enter`. 
- Open Vim and by type `vi` then press `Enter`
- Install plugin by type `:PlugInstall` and hit `Enter`.
- The status bar doesn’t look like the one from Vim Airline official website, that’s because we have to configure the fonts, run the following commands to install the missing fonts for powerline theme:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1 \
  && cd fonts \
  && ./install.sh \
  && cd .. \
  && rm -rf fonts
  ```

- Finally, edit `~/.vimrc` and add the following line:

  ```sh
  let g:airline_powerline_fonts = 1
  ```

- This will automatically populate the g:airline_symbols dictionary with the powerline symbols.
- Now our Vim editor should have a better look:
- To make our Vim look more professional, I choose [OneDark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim) theme.
- To install the theme for Vim, first run the following command in Terminal:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim.git ~/onedark \
  && cd ~/onedark \
  && mkdir ~/.vim/colors \
  && cp colors/onedark.vim ~/.vim/colors/ \
  && cp autoload/onedark.vim ~/.vim/autoload/
  ```

- Then edit `~/.vimrc` and add the following:

  ```sh
  colorscheme onedark
  syntax on
  set number
  highlight Normal ctermbg=None
  highlight LineNr ctermfg=DarkGrey
  ```
